## üìå Overview
This guide assists teams in understanding the ClearML migration scope, highlighting the data that can be migrated from `<Source Environment>` to `<Target Environment>`, as well as the elements that will not be updated post-migration.

## ‚úÖ Migratable Data
The following ClearML data and configurations **will** be successfully migrated from `<Source Environment>` to `<Target Environment>`:

- **Datasets**: ClearML-managed datasets with the following statuses will be migrated: **created, in_progress, stopped, closed, failed, completed, queued, published, publishing,** and **unknown**. The migration will include metadata under all relevant tabs, except where noted in the "Data that will not be migrated" section:
  - Execution
  - Configuration
  - Artifacts
  - Dataview
  - Info
  - Console
  - Scalar
  - Plots
  - Debug samples

- **Tasks**: Similarly, tasks with the same statuses (**created, in_progress, stopped, closed, failed, completed, queued, published, publishing,** and **unknown**) will be included in the migration, along with all metadata under their respective tabs, unless stated otherwise in the "Data that will not be migrated" section.
  
- **Pipelines**: Pipelines that are in any of the aforementioned statuses will also be migrated, including all metadata under their respective tabs, unless specified otherwise in the "Data that will not be migrated" section.
  
- **S3 Data**: If files inside your S3 bucket are too large to be transferred, you can approach Jovan from AI-Engineering Cluster to perform backend transfer of data from `<Source Environment>` ‚ûî `<Target Environment>` on your behalf.  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the file structure of the folder must remain unchanged during this process.**
  
- **Fileserver Data**: Data stored in fileserver will be migrated over and stored in the S3 of `<Target Environment>`.
  
- **Artifacts URLs (e.g., models), debug images' URLs, and hyper datasets' frames' URLs**: Links / URLs will be updated as part of the migration process.

## ‚ùå Data that will not be migrated
Certain components of ClearML data will **not** be migrated to `<Target Environment>`:

- **Datasets**: Specifically, the **destination** data under the **Execution** tab and the **status reason** under the **Info** tab for datasets will not be migrated.
- **Tasks**: Specifically, the **destination** data under the **Execution** tab and the following items under the **Info** tab for Tasks will not be migrated:
  - **Status reason**
  - **Status message**
  - **Queue**
- **Pipelines**: The **status reason** under the **Info** tab for Pipelines will not be migrated.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data that will not be updated Post-Migration
Certain ClearML components **will not be updated** after migration and retain their original values:

- **Console Log URLs**: While console logs can be migrated, the URLs within these logs will not be updated to reflect the correct links in `<Target Environment>`.
